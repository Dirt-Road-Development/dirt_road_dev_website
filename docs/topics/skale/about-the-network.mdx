SKALE offers a unique take on both Web3 and the decentralization behind it comparitavely to the majority of the platforms that currently exist.

## Built to SKALE

SKALE Network does not have capacity limits, especially in comparision to other networks. With capacity generally judged by Transactions-Per-Second (TPS) for a blockchain network; touting a higher TPS does not guarnatee more resources. This is because the techincal limits of the architecure can often get in the way. 

SKALE uses a modular architecure through the form of containerization which not only allows for a better usage of compute resources, but it also increases the security. The more chains that the SKALE Network adds, the greater the TPS available to the network as a whole. 

This is where the confusion comes in for most people. Total TPS for the SKALE Network, i.e if it has 12,000 TPS available would mean that there are somewhere around 100 chains. However, most singular apps will never need a total of 12,000 TPS and instead will need a significantly lower number. SKALE Network enables chains that are not impacted by others meaning that applications such as social networks, gaming, and finance can benefit from dedicated throughput without impacting other unrelated areas.

## Zero Gas Fees

This is the one piece that has caught and held nearly everyone that has been introduced to SKALE from the moment it is mentioned. 
SKALE Network is one of the very few blockchains that does not charge users a monetary value on every transaction.

It utilizes a subscription style model where the developers and projects rent resources in the form of a SKALE Chain; and then the individual chains utilize a gasless value called SKALE FUEL (sFUEL) that is free for users to transact. 

This opens up the door for free, freemium, and trial based blockchain software where individuals can play to earn, play for free, and most important start for free depending on the dApp. This unique factor is a needle in the haystack in the blockchain space and will open up the door for long-term adoption to blockchain and Web3 in comparision with many of the "top" Layer-2 and Sidechain networks.
