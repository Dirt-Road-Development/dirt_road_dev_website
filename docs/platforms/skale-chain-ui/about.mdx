title: About the SKALE Chain UI

## SKALE Network

SKALE is an amazing multi-chain network that enables a nearly infinite amount of Ethereum compatible blockchains that enables high-usage dApps to have their own chains and less passive dApps to utilize shared Hubs. 


Every SKALE chain has an owner on the Ethereum mainnet that is required to be a multi-signature wallet (i.e more than one person has shared control). 

SKALE chains themselves can be made incredibley secure, however, setting up and managing a SKALE chain is not a simple task. 

There are a lot of roles, actions, and options to take into account. In order to streamline the process for developers on the SKALE network both now and in the future, Dirt Road Dev has built and will continue to build and support the SKALE Chain UI.

## What is it?

It is a grpahical user interface (i.e GUI) that is available in a single location that works for any SKALE Chain.

It utilizes the smart contracts on the SKALE Network to faciliate processes for the owners of a chain. 

If you are not a developer, this tool is probably not for you :)
