## SKALE Network

SKALE is an amazing multi-chain network that enables a nearly infinite amount of Ethereum compatible blockchains that enables high-usage dApps to have their own chains and less passive dApps to utilize shared Hubs.

Every SKALE chain in the network runs similar software. While chain owners have the ability to customize and tweak their chain, SKALE chains come standard with a key piece of usability: value-less gas. This means that users are no longer paying for each and every transaction, they never have to pay at all. 

With a gas-less network, comes big responsibility on the developers and dApps in order to make sure that users always have enough sFUEL or SKALE Fuel.

## sFUEL Station

The sFUEL Station was designed and implemented to provide new and existing users a simplified process for attaining sFUEL across the entire SKALEVERSE. Claiming sFUEL on multiple dApps in a different way could become cumbersome to users very quickly as SKALE adds more chains moving into the future. 

The sFUEL Station offers individuals the ability to quickly attain sFUEL for various chains that are supported. It also supports custom developer options that allow chain owners to provision higher levels of sFUEL to developers on the chain.

## Location

The sFUEL Station is available at [https://sfuel.dirtroad.dev](https://sfuel.dirtroad.dev). For developers using SKALE Staging (Testnets) Networks, there is a developer sFUEL station located at [https://testnet.sfuel.dirtroad.dev](https://testnet.sfuel.dirtroad.dev).
