title: Using the Station
---

The following steps will take you through using the sFUEL Station.

### Step 1: Visit the sFUEL Station

Start by visiting the [sFUEL Station](https://sfuel.dirtroad.dev).

### Step 2: Connect a Wallet

In the top right corner, click Connect Wallet. Your options include:

- MetaMask (Most Popular)
- Wallet Connect
- Coinbase Wallet

A couple of things to remember:


1. If you **do not** have access to any of these, you will not be able to use the sFUEL Station as this time.

2. You may connect to **ANY** network. The software does not require a direct signature to use.

### Step 3: Claim sFUEL

Claiming sFUEL is as easy as selecting a chain and clicking Claim sFUEL! Once you click it should take a few seconds to do some magical mathematics and blockchain-y stuff under the hood. 

Please remember **you may not see the value reflected in your wallet depending on what chain you are connected to!**
