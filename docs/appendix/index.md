### Containers
Containers are used as a technical term throughout the docs. Understanding containers can be hard, so to simplify it we can think of containers as isolated processes designed to act as a computer.
Containerization offers lower overhead and more efficient use of resources. It is a common term and piece of technology in software today.

### Bitcoin
Bitcoin is an open-source Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network run via blockchain technology that enables true ownership of assets. It was the first blockchain successfully launched and currently the largest in the world in terms of value.

### Blockchain
Technically, a blockchain is a network of computers all running the same software recording and communicating together to keep a record. In laymans terms, a whole bunch of untrusting computers keep state of something that cannot change. Examples of blockchain are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SKALE Network.


### Ethereum
The first programmable blockchain; Ethereum is the largest and most established Layer-1 blockchain. This blockchain offers decentralized functionality through smart contracts that cannot be changed.

### Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
The term peer-to-peer means there is no middleman during a connection or message. This can often be understood through the transfer of money. Instead of sending money to someone and going through a bank or an application; P2P means you would transact with the recipient directly.

### SKALE Network

A high performance multi-chain network that utilizes the Ethereum mainnet for decentralized security. Instant finality, free transactions, and infinite scalability means that SKALE has the ability to offer projects and users unique experiences by default.
