Welcome to the first offical blog post for Dirt Road Dev.

If you are here and have no idea why, that is not only ok, but that is expected. 

The existing landscape for building software is complicted. Languages, frameworks, opinions, and tools are in abundance; however, guidance and education is limited. 

Blog posts on Medium rarely count as production ready education, and more so, the understanding someone gains from a blog post is usually minimal. 

Failure is the best way to success, however, failing with guidance is not something most individuals are comfortable with, as it means sharing their downfalls, exposing their flaws. 

Dirt Road Development (or Dirt Road Dev) is here to enable individuals to have somewhere to look, somewhere to go, and someone to help them understand; while also providing the right "crutch" to begin.

Tooling, tutorials, guides, and more will continually be released in order to help developers grow and build in a highly volatile and constantly advancing space. 

Welcome to Dirt Road Development!
