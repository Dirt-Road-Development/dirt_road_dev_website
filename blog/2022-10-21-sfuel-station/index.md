TLDR; The sFUEL Station has been upgraded to support a new chain, has a brand new UI, and now automatically fills you up across all chains. How to support the station is at the bottom of the article.

## What is the sFUEL Station?

The sFUEL Station located [here](https://sfuel.dirtroad.dev) is a community run application enabling users to attain fuel for various chains within the SKALEVERSE.
It is designed to be as simple as possible to use and to allow SKALIENs the ability to quickly get started using the SKALE Network.

## What is new?

The new changes include:
- A brand new User Interface that is minimal and simple to understand
- A new chain: [Razor Network](https://razor.network)
- A faster fill up time by filling your wallet up on every supported chain at once
